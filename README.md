## Features

1. **Text-Based Interface:**

   * Runs in the terminal using the `ncurses` library for display and input.
   * Supports colored text and bold formatting.

2. **Nerd Font and ASCII Support:**

   * Option to use Unicode Nerd Font symbols or simple ASCII characters for all game elements (heart, meteor, player rocket, rays).
   * Configurable via command-line flag (`--nerdfont` or `-n`).

3. **Player Controls:**

   * Move player character (rocket) using arrow keys or `WASD`.
   * Fire rays upwards using the `E` key.

4. **Gameplay Mechanics:**

   * Meteors randomly spawn at the top of the screen and fall downwards.
   * Player can shoot rays upwards to destroy meteors and gain points.
   * If a meteor hits the player, the player loses health.
   * Player starts with 100 health points and 5 rays (ammo).
   * Rays decrease by one per shot.

5. **Health and Ammunition Regeneration:**

   * Every 30 seconds, the player regains 10 health points and 2 rays.

6. **Score System:**

   * Player earns 5 points for each meteor destroyed.

7. **Dynamic Screen Handling:**

   * Supports resizing the terminal window.
   * Adjusts meteor tracking array accordingly.

8. **Statistics Display:**

   * Shows player health, number of rays left, and score at the bottom of the screen.
   * Statistics visibility can be toggled via command-line option `--statistics visible|invisible`.

9. **Game Over Condition:**

   * Game ends when player health reaches zero or the player quits by pressing `q`.
   * Displays final score after game ends.

10. **Performance:**

    * Updates meteor positions every 0.1 seconds.
    * Spawns meteors randomly every 0.1 seconds.
